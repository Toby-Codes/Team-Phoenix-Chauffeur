# Team Phoenix Chauffeur Templates

## Getting Started

You're to commence working on a variant only if the template's PM assigns its UX design and Clubhouse story to you.
:rotating_light: Kindly note that unauthorized PRs would not be merged.
To get started, fork and proceed to clone your forked copy.
Switch to develop branch

```
$ git checkout develop
```

Add main repository as upstream remote

```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/hngi/Team-Phoenix-Chauffeur.git
```

Preferably, create a new branch from the develop branch.
For example, while you're still in the develop branch,

```
$ git checkout -b company-variant-branch
```

### Repo Folder Structure and Implementation Suggestions

Directories for your task have been created already. Simply cd into your task directory, write your HTML, CSS or JS into the already provided index.html, style.css or index.js respectively. All image/media assets should be put into the assets folder.
To accentuate your speed and fasttrack your development, you are encouraged to use SASS (SCSS), Bootstrap or your preferred CSS framework.

### Submitting tasks/Making PRs

Proceed to make your edits, commit and PR to develop branch of main repository.
:rotating_light: While submitting your PR, you must also submit a live working version of your code and your clubhouse link unless your PR wouldn't be merged

Regards.
